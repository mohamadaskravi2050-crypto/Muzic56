This is a website for uploading and listening to music, creating playlists, liking tracks, and managing music. The name of the project is intentionally misspelled :)
It’s possible to add many more and better systems to the website, but since this site is just a portfolio project for me and I didn’t have enough time, I decided to leave it as it is.
To run this website, you need a virtual server and several plugins that you have to install using pip.
